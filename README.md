# Liver_Prediction

Analysis and Prediction-Indian Liver Patients.

The dataset was downloaded from the UCI ML Repository.

Here are the steps I'm going to perform:
1) Data Analysis: This is in general looking at the data to figure out whats going on. Inspect the data: Check whether there is any missing data, irrelevant data and do a cleanup.
2) Data Visualization:
3) Feature selection.
4) Search for any trends, relations & correlations.
5) Draw an inference and predict whether the patient can be identified to be having liver disease or not
